This is MOGO, My Own Geroge Object; a play on the acronym POCO (Plain Old CLR Object).

The idea is to ask it questions and it'll try to answer them.

I'm fairly certain this is one of my first (if not the first) C# GUI programs I made (I just haven't uploaded to Github until now).

**If you're having problems on what to ask it, you can type: readme? README? or help? and press the "Ask!" button to have it create a README txt file (in the same directory) of what questions you can ask it.**
